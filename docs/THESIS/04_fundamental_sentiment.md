# Chapter 4: Fundamental and Sentiment Analysis

## 4.1 Fundamental Analysis Framework

### 4.1.1 Financial Ratio Analysis
The system employs a comprehensive set of financial ratios to evaluate company performance:

1. **Profitability Ratios**
   - Return on Equity (ROE) = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity
   - Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue
   - Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue

2. **Valuation Ratios**
   - Price to Earnings (P/E) = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share
   - Price to Book (P/B) = Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share
   - Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)

3. **Liquidity Ratios**
   - Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
   - Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
   - Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

### 4.1.2 Industry Analysis
- Sector performance metrics
- Competitive positioning
- Market share analysis

### 4.1.3 Macroeconomic Indicators
- Interest rates
- Inflation metrics
- GDP growth
- Sector-specific indicators

## 4.2 Sentiment Analysis 

### 4.2.1 News Sentiment Analysis
The system processes news data using natural language processing:

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   ```python
   def preprocess_news_text(text: str) -> str:
       """
       Clean and normalize news text for sentiment analysis
       """
       text = text.lower()
       text = remove_special_characters(text)
       text = remove_stopwords(text)
       return text
   ```

2. **Sentiment Scoring**
   - VADER sentiment analysis for financial texts
   - Custom financial domain-specific lexicon
   - Contextual sentiment classification

### 4.2.2 Market Sentiment Indicators
1. **Technical Sentiment**
   - Put/Call Ratio
   - VIX (Volatility Index)
   - Advance/Decline Ratio

2. **Social Media Sentiment**
   - Twitter sentiment analysis
   - Reddit discussion monitoring
   - StockTwits sentiment tracking

### 4.2.3 Behavioral Analytics
1. **Investor Behavior Metrics**
   - Fund flows
   - Retail vs. institutional trading patterns
   - Short interest ratios

2. **Market Psychology**
   - Fear & Greed Index components
   - Momentum indicators
   - Sentiment extremes detection

## 4.3 Integration Framework

### 4.3.1 Signal Generation
The system combines fundamental and sentiment signals:

```python
def generate_combined_signal(
    fundamental_scores: Dict[str, float],
    sentiment_scores: Dict[str, float],
    weights: Dict[str, float]
) -> float:
    """
    Generate combined trading signal from fundamental and sentiment scores
    
    Parameters:
    - fundamental_scores: Dict of fundamental metrics and their values
    - sentiment_scores: Dict of sentiment metrics and their values
    - weights: Dict of weights for each component
    
    Returns:
    - Combined signal score (-1 to +1)
    """
    signal = 0.0
    
    # Combine fundamental signals
    for metric, score in fundamental_scores.items():
        signal += score * weights.get(f'fundamental_{metric}', 0)
        
    # Add sentiment signals
    for metric, score in sentiment_scores.items():
        signal += score * weights.get(f'sentiment_{metric}', 0)
        
    # Normalize to [-1, 1] range
    return np.clip(signal, -1, 1)
```

### 4.3.2 Signal Validation
1. **Historical Backtesting**
   - Signal predictive power analysis
   - False signal filtering
   - Signal decay analysis

2. **Cross-Validation**
   - Out-of-sample testing
   - Time series cross-validation
   - Robustness checks

### 4.3.3 Dynamic Weight Adjustment
The system employs adaptive weights based on market regimes:

1. **Market Regime Detection**
   - Volatility regimes
   - Trend regimes
   - Correlation regimes

2. **Weight Optimization**
   - Bayesian optimization
   - Walk-forward analysis
   - Maximum Sharpe ratio optimization

## 4.4 Performance Analysis

### 4.4.1 Signal Performance Metrics
1. **Prediction Accuracy**
   - Hit rate
   - False positive rate
   - Signal-to-noise ratio

2. **Return Attribution**
   - Factor attribution
   - Risk-adjusted returns
   - Maximum drawdown analysis

### 4.4.2 Risk Metrics
1. **Signal Risk**
   - Signal volatility
   - Confidence intervals
   - Prediction error analysis

2. **Portfolio Impact**
   - Position sizing implications
   - Portfolio turnover impact
   - Transaction cost analysis
