![Data Pipeline Architecture](docs/images/data_pipeline_architecture.png)

## 2. Core Architecture & Setup (`download_nifty500_data.py`)

The `download_nifty500_data.py` script orchestrates the entire data collection process. It leverages several key Python libraries and a structured configuration.

![System Architecture](docs/images/system_architecture.png)

### 2.1. Key Libraries & Their Roles

- **`yfinance`**: The primary workhorse for fetching data from Yahoo Finance. It provides access to historical stock prices, trading volumes, company fundamentals (income statements, balance sheets, cash flow), news headlines, option chain data, and institutional holder information.

  *Significance*: Offers a free and relatively comprehensive source for global financial data, including Indian equities with the `.NS` suffix.

- **`pandas`**: Essential for data manipulation and analysis. All fetched data is typically loaded into pandas DataFrames for cleaning, transformation, calculation of indicators, and storage.

  *Significance*: Provides powerful and flexible data structures (DataFrame, Series) that are ideal for time-series and tabular financial data.

- **`numpy`**: Used for numerical operations, especially array manipulations and mathematical functions that underpin many financial calculations.

  *Significance*: Offers efficient numerical computation, often used by pandas and other libraries under the hood.

- **`talib` (Ta-Lib)**: A widely used library for technical analysis, specifically for calculating candlestick pattern recognitions (e.g., Doji, Hammer, Engulfing patterns). The script uses functions like `talib.CDLDOJI()`.

  *Significance*: Provides pre-built, optimized functions for many common technical indicators and patterns, saving development time and ensuring correctness.

- **`concurrent.futures`**: Enables parallel execution of tasks, particularly useful for downloading data for multiple stocks simultaneously, significantly speeding up the overall process. `ThreadPoolExecutor` is used.

  *Significance*: Improves performance by leveraging multi-threading for I/O-bound tasks like data downloading.

### 2.2. Configuration

- **Logging Setup**:

```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

This configures application-wide logging to output messages with a timestamp, log level, and the message itself. `INFO` level provides a good balance of detail.

- **Global Market Definitions**:

  - `INDIAN_SECTOR_INDICES`: A dictionary mapping Yahoo Finance tickers for Indian sector indices (e.g., `^CNXBANK` for Nifty Bank) to their names.

    *Purpose*: Used for sector-specific relative strength analysis and benchmarking.

  - `GLOBAL_INDICES`: Includes major global stock market indices (e.g., S&P 500 `^GSPC`, FTSE 100 `^FTSE`).

    *Purpose*: Essential for intermarket correlation analysis to understand how Indian markets are influenced by or move with global trends.

  - `COMMODITIES_BONDS`: Lists tickers for key commodities (e.g., Gold `GC=F`, Crude Oil `CL=F`) and bond yields (e.g., US 10-Year Treasury `^TNX`).

    *Purpose*: Also for intermarket analysis, as these assets can significantly impact equity markets and reflect economic conditions. For example, rising oil prices can affect inflation and specific sectors.

## 3. Phase 1: Symbol Universe & Metadata Acquisition

Before any stock-specific data can be downloaded, the pipeline must first identify the current constituents of the Nifty 500 index and gather relevant metadata like sector and industry classifications.

### 3.1. Fetching Nifty 500 Symbols (`get_nifty500_symbols`)

- **Purpose**: To obtain an accurate and up-to-date list of stock symbols that are part of the Nifty 500 index. This list forms the universe of stocks for which data will be downloaded.

- **Process**:

1. **Caching**: The function first checks for a local cache file (`data/nifty500_symbols.json`). If the cached list is recent (e.g., less than 24 hours old), it's used to avoid redundant downloads and reduce load on the NSE server.

   ```python
   cache_file = Path("data/nifty500_symbols.json")
   if cache_file.exists():
       # ... load from cache if recent ...
   ```

   *Significance*: Improves performance and respects data provider limits.

2. **Fetching from NSE India**: If the cache is missing or stale, the script attempts to download the list from the official NSE India website using URLs like:

   ```text
   "https://archives.nseindia.com/content/indices/ind_nifty500list.csv"
   ```

   A `User-Agent` header is set in the `requests.get` call to mimic a browser, which can be necessary to access some websites.

   *Significance*: Ensures the symbol list is sourced from the authoritative provider.

3. **Symbol Formatting**: The downloaded symbols (e.g., "RELIANCE") are appended with `.NS` (e.g., "RELIANCE.NS") to make them compatible with Yahoo Finance's ticker format for Indian stocks.

4. **Sector & Industry Mapping**: The CSV file from NSE typically contains sector and industry information for each stock.

   ```python
   sector_col = next((col for col in ['Sector', 'Industry', ...] if col in df.columns), None)
   # ...
   SECTOR_MAPPING = {f"{row['Symbol']}.NS": row[sector_col] for _, row in df.iterrows()}
   ```

   This information is extracted and stored in global dictionaries `SECTOR_MAPPING` and `INDUSTRY_MAPPING`.

   *Significance*: Crucial for sector-based analysis, relative strength comparisons against sector peers, and building sector-rotation strategies.

### 3.2. Enriching Sector Data (`_enrich_sector_data`)

- **Purpose**: If the sector or industry data obtained from the NSE CSV is incomplete or missing for some symbols, this function attempts to fill these gaps using Yahoo Finance.

- **Process**:

```python
ticker = yf.Ticker(symbol)
info = ticker.info
if 'sector' in info and info['sector']:
    SECTOR_MAPPING[symbol] = info['sector']
```

For each symbol with missing data, it fetches the `ticker.info` dictionary from Yahoo Finance and extracts the `sector` and `industry` fields if available.

- **Significance**: Aims to ensure that every stock in the universe has associated sector and industry metadata, which is vital for comprehensive analysis. This also acts as a fallback.

## 4. Phase 2: Individual Stock Data Acquisition & Processing

Once the symbol universe is defined, the pipeline processes each stock individually to gather a wide array of data points. The `download_historical_data_for_symbol` function in `download_nifty500_data.py` often serves as a mini-orchestrator for fetching price/volume and then triggering technical indicator and relative strength calculations for a single symbol. It internally calls `download_stock_data` from `download_stock_data.py`.

### 4.A. Historical Price & Volume Data (via `download_stock_data.py`)

- **Core Function**: The actual download is handled by `download_stock_data` (from `download_stock_data.py`), which is called by `download_historical_data_for_symbol` in the main `download_nifty500_data.py` script.

- **Purpose**: To obtain historical Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Volume (OHLCV) for each stock. This is the foundational data for most forms of technical analysis and strategy backtesting.

- **Process**:

  - Utilizes `yf.Ticker(symbol).history(start=start_date, end=end_date, interval=interval, auto_adjust=True)`.
  - `start_date`, `end_date`: Define the period for historical data (e.g., last 5 years).
  - `interval`: Specifies the data frequency (e.g., '1d' for daily, '1h' for hourly).
  - `auto_adjust=True`: This is crucial as it provides prices adjusted for corporate actions like stock splits and dividends.

- *Significance of Adjusted Prices*: Ensures that historical price series are comparable over time, preventing artificial jumps or drops due to corporate actions that don't reflect a change in the company's fundamental value. For example, after a 2:1 stock split, the price halves, but `auto_adjust=True` scales historical prices down to maintain continuity.

- **Data Quality Checks**:

  - **Non-empty data**: Ensure some data was returned.
  - **Sufficient data points**: Check if the number of records is adequate for analysis.
  - **Presence of OHLCV columns**: Verify that 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume' are present.
  - **Logical consistency**: High â‰¥ Low, High â‰¥ Open/Close, Low â‰¤ Open/Close
  - **Non-negative volume**: Volume traded cannot be negative.

- **RELIANCE.NS Example**:

```python
data = yf.Ticker("RELIANCE.NS").history(period="2y", interval="1d", auto_adjust=True)
```

A typical row for RELIANCE.NS on June 8, 2025:
```text
Date: 2025-06-08, Open: 1430.00, High: 1465.00, Low: 1425.00, Close: 1448.80, Volume: 5,200,100
```

### 4.B. Technical Indicators

- **Integration**: Technical indicators are typically calculated after the raw OHLCV data is fetched. The `download_historical_data_for_symbol` function calls `add_technical_indicators` (from `technical_indicators.py`) and also includes direct `talib` calls for candlestick patterns.

- **Purpose**: To transform raw price and volume data into quantitative signals that can help identify trends, momentum, volatility, market turning points, and other trading opportunities. They form the core inputs for many trading strategies.

![Technical Indicators Classification](docs/images/technical_indicators_classification.png)

- **Methodology**:

  - Many standard indicators (SMA, EMA, MACD, etc.) are calculated using pandas rolling window functions (`.rolling().mean()`, `.ewm().mean()`).
  - Specific candlestick patterns are identified using functions from the `talib` library (e.g., `talib.CDLDOJI`).

- **Key Indicators Covered**:

1. **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**

   - **Purpose**: Smooths out price data to identify the direction of the trend. Longer SMAs reflect long-term trends, shorter SMAs reflect short-term trends.
   - **Formula**: Sum of closing prices over N periods / N.
   - **Interpretation**: Price above SMA is often seen as bullish, below as bearish. Crossovers of different SMAs (e.g., 20-day SMA crossing above 50-day SMA - a "golden cross") can signal trend changes.
   - **RELIANCE.NS Example**: "On June 8, 2025, RELIANCE.NS closed at â‚¹1,448.80. Its 20-day SMA was â‚¹1,428.37 and 50-day SMA was â‚¹1,354.07. Since the price is above both SMAs and the 20-day SMA is above the 50-day SMA, this suggests a bullish trend in the short to medium term."

![Trend Following Strategy](docs/images/trend_following.png)

2. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**

   - **Purpose**: Similar to SMA but gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.
   - **Formula**: (Close - Previous EMA) * Multiplier + Previous EMA, where Multiplier = 2 / (N + 1).
   - **Interpretation**: Used like SMAs for trend identification and crossover signals, but reacts faster.
   - **RELIANCE.NS Example**: "RELIANCE.NS's 20-day EMA on June 8, 2025 is approximately â‚¹1,425.50, slightly different from its SMA due to the exponential weighting, offering a quicker reflection of recent price action."

3. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**

   - **Purpose**: A momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It indicates overbought or oversold conditions.
   - **Formula**: `100 - (100 / (1 + RS))`, where RS = (Average Gain over N periods) / (Average Loss over N periods). Typically N=14.
   - **Interpretation**: Values range from 0 to 100.
     - RSI > 70: Often considered overbought (potential for a price pullback).
     - RSI < 30: Often considered oversold (potential for a price bounce).
     - Divergences: Bullish divergence (price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low) or bearish divergence (price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high) can signal trend reversals.
   - **RELIANCE.NS Example**: "On June 8, 2025, RELIANCE.NS had a 14-day RSI of 62.72. This value is in neutral territory, suggesting moderate momentum that is neither overbought nor oversold. The stock shows healthy upward momentum that is not yet extreme."

![Momentum Strategy](docs/images/momentum_strategy.png)

4. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**

   - **Purpose**: A trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two EMAs of a security's price (typically 12-period EMA and 26-period EMA).
   - **Formula**: MACD Line = 12-period EMA - 26-period EMA. Signal Line = 9-period EMA of MACD Line. Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - Crossovers: MACD Line crossing above Signal Line is bullish; below is bearish.
     - Zero Line Crossover: MACD Line crossing above zero is bullish; below is bearish.
     - Divergences: Similar to RSI, divergences between MACD and price can signal trend changes.
   - **RELIANCE.NS Example**: "For RELIANCE.NS on June 8, 2025, the MACD line was 19.57 and the Signal line was 22.51. With the MACD line below the signal line, this indicates bearish momentum in the short term despite the overall uptrend."

5. **Bollinger Bands (BBands)**

   - **Purpose**: Measure market volatility and identify overbought/oversold conditions relative to a moving average.
   - **Formula**:
     - Middle Band: N-period SMA (typically 20-day).
     - Upper Band: Middle Band + (K * N-period Standard Deviation of Price) (typically K=2).
     - Lower Band: Middle Band - (K * N-period Standard Deviation of Price).
   - **Interpretation**:
     - Price touching Upper Band: Potentially overbought.
     - Price touching Lower Band: Potentially oversold.
     - Band Squeeze: Low volatility, often precedes a significant price move.
     - Band Expansion: High volatility.
   - **RELIANCE.NS Example**: "On June 8, 2025, RELIANCE.NS was trading at â‚¹1,448.80, very close to its Upper Bollinger Band at â‚¹1,457.54, suggesting the stock is approaching short-term resistance or indicating strong momentum continuation."

6. **Average True Range (ATR)**

   - **Purpose**: Measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for that period.
   - **Formula**: Typically a 14-day smoothed moving average of True Range values. True Range = max[(High - Low), abs(High - Previous Close), abs(Low - Previous Close)].
   - **Interpretation**: Higher ATR indicates higher volatility; lower ATR indicates lower volatility. Not directional. Often used for setting stop-loss levels or position sizing.
   - **RELIANCE.NS Example**: "An ATR of â‚¹23.58 for RELIANCE.NS on June 8, 2025 means the stock has an average daily price range of roughly â‚¹23.58 over the last 14 days, indicating moderate volatility suitable for position sizing calculations."

7. **Commodity Channel Index (CCI)**

   - **Purpose**: A momentum-based oscillator used to help determine when an investment vehicle is reaching a condition of being overbought or oversold.
   - **Formula**: (Typical Price - N-period SMA of Typical Price) / (0.015 * N-period Mean Deviation of Typical Price). Typical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3.
   - **Interpretation**: Values above +100 suggest overbought; below -100 suggest oversold.
   - **RELIANCE.NS Example**: "A CCI reading of approximately +85 for RELIANCE.NS would indicate near-overbought conditions but not extreme, suggesting continued upward pressure."

8. **Average Directional Index (ADX), Plus Directional Indicator (+DI), Minus Directional Indicator (-DI)**

   - **Purpose**: ADX measures trend strength (not direction). +DI and -DI measure trend direction.
   - **Interpretation**:
     - ADX > 25: Strong trend (either up or down). ADX < 20: Weak or non-trending market.
     - +DI above -DI: Bullish trend. -DI above +DI: Bearish trend.
     - Crossovers of +DI and -DI can signal trend changes, confirmed by ADX strength.
   - **RELIANCE.NS Example**: "RELIANCE.NS has an ADX of 24.18, indicating a moderately strong trend. With the +DI likely above -DI given the uptrend, this confirms the bullish direction with decent momentum."

9. **Money Flow Index (MFI)**

   - **Purpose**: A momentum indicator that incorporates volume and price data. It's also known as volume-weighted RSI.
   - **Interpretation**: Similar to RSI for overbought (>80) / oversold (<20) conditions and divergences.
   - **RELIANCE.NS Example**: "An MFI of approximately 68 for RELIANCE.NS suggests significant buying pressure, indicating institutional and retail interest remains strong."

10. **On-Balance Volume (OBV)**

    - **Purpose**: A momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price.
    - **Interpretation**: Rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices. Falling OBV signals negative volume pressure. Divergences between OBV and price are noteworthy.
    - **RELIANCE.NS Example**: "RELIANCE.NS price is making new highs and its OBV has also been generally rising over the trend period, confirming the uptrend has strong volume support."

11. **Rate of Change (ROC)**

    - **Purpose**: A momentum oscillator that measures the percentage change in price between the current price and the price N periods ago.
    - **Interpretation**: Positive ROC indicates upward momentum; negative ROC indicates downward momentum. Zero line crossovers can be used as signals.
    - **RELIANCE.NS Example**: "A 10-day ROC of approximately 1.8% for RELIANCE.NS means its price has increased by 1.8% over the last 10 trading days, showing positive but moderate momentum."

12. **Candlestick Patterns (Identified using `talib` functions like `talib.CDLDOJI`, `talib.CDLHAMMER`, etc.)**:

    - **Purpose**: These are short-term patterns (1-3 candles) that can indicate potential reversals or continuations. The `download_nifty500_data.py` script calculates many of these.
    - **Examples**:
      - **Doji**: Indicates indecision. A day where open and close are very close.
      - **Hammer**: Bullish reversal pattern typically found at the bottom of a downtrend. Small body, long lower shadow, little to no upper shadow.
      - **Engulfing (Bullish/Bearish)**: A two-candle reversal pattern. A Bullish Engulfing has a small bearish candle followed by a large bullish candle that engulfs the prior one.
    - **Interpretation**: The output from `talib` functions is typically a series of numbers (0 for no pattern, 100 for bullish pattern, -100 for bearish pattern on a given day).

## 8. Troubleshooting and Edge Cases

### 8.1. Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Data Download Failures

*Problem*: Network timeouts, API rate limits, corrupted data

*Solution*:

```python
def robust_download_with_fallback(symbol, max_retries=5):
    """
    Multi-source data download with fallback mechanisms
    
    Data source priority:
    1. Yahoo Finance (primary)
    2. NSE direct API (secondary)
    3. Local cache (emergency)
    """
    sources = [
        lambda: yf.download(symbol),
        lambda: download_from_nse_direct(symbol),
        lambda: load_from_cache(symbol)
    ]
    
    for attempt, source_func in enumerate(sources):
        try:
            data = source_func()
            if validate_data_quality(data):
                return data
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Source {attempt+1} failed for {symbol}: {e}")
            continue
    
    raise Exception(f"All data sources failed for {symbol}")
```

#### 2. Indicator Calculation Errors

*Problem*: Division by zero, insufficient data, numerical instability

*Solution*:

```python
def safe_indicator_calculation(func, data, **kwargs):
    """
    Wrapper for safe indicator calculations
    
    Handles:
    - Insufficient data periods
    - Division by zero errors
    - Numerical overflow/underflow
    - Missing data points
    """
    try:
        # Check minimum data requirements
        min_periods = kwargs.get('min_periods', 20)
        if len(data) < min_periods:
            return pd.Series(np.nan, index=data.index)
        
        # Execute calculation with error handling
        result = func(data, **kwargs)
        
        # Validate results
        if result.isna().all():
            logger.warning(f"All NaN values in {func.__name__}")
            return pd.Series(np.nan, index=data.index)
        
        return result
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in {func.__name__}: {e}")
        return pd.Series(np.nan, index=data.index)
```

#### 3. Memory Management Issues

*Problem*: Out of memory errors with large datasets

*Solution*:

```python
def memory_efficient_processing(symbols, chunk_size=50):
    """
    Process large datasets in chunks to avoid memory issues
    
    Strategies:
    - Chunk processing
    - Data type optimization
    - Garbage collection
    - Disk-based caching
    """
    results = {}
    
    for i in range(0, len(symbols), chunk_size):
        chunk = symbols[i:i+chunk_size]
        
        # Process chunk
        chunk_results = process_symbol_chunk(chunk)
        results.update(chunk_results)
        
        # Force garbage collection
        gc.collect()
        
        # Optional: Save intermediate results to disk
        if len(results) % 100 == 0:
            save_intermediate_results(results)
    
    return results
```
